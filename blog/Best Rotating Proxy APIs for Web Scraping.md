## What Is a Scraping Proxy API?

A **proxy API** is an application programming interface that provides proxy services. Instead of manually managing proxies, you send a request to the API, and the service takes care of handling proxies for your scraper. This includes managing proxy rotation, handling delays, and ensuring you get optimal performance.
