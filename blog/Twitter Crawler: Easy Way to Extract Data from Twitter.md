# Twitter Crawler: Easy Way to Extract Data from Twitter

Extracting data from Twitter can be achieved by using either pre-built tools or creating your own custom Twitter crawler. The key difference between a web scraper and a crawler lies in the scale of data and depth of extraction. Crawling involves iteratively finding and fetching web links starting from seed URLs, such as gathering a list of Twitter profiles or tweets. On the other hand, scraping focuses on extracting specific data points, such as profile details or tweet content, from those links. While these terms are interconnected, crawling is not possible without scraping.

Several tools, such as [Octoparse](https://www.octoparse.com/tutorial/automatically-scrape-dynamic-websites-exampletwitter?qu) and [Twitter Scraper from Scraping Expert](https://scrapingexpert.com/twitter-scraper/), offer completed solutions for extracting Twitter data. However, in this article, weâ€™ll explore how to build your own Twitter crawler, examine third-party Python scripts, and learn ways to minimize the risk of getting blocked by Twitter.

## Building a Twitter Crawler Using Python

Python offers excellent libraries like [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) and [Twython](https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/twython) to simplify the creation of a Twitter crawler. Below are a few practical solutions provided by various developers:

### Solution 1: Crawling Tweets by Hashtag Without API
- **Author**: Amit Upreti ([Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/hands-on-web-scraping-building-your-own-twitter-dataset-with-python-and-scrapy-8823fb7d0598))
- **Overview**: This solution uses Python and the `Scrapy` framework to scrape tweets by hashtags without authenticating with Twitterâ€™s API. By accessing Twitter's mobile version, it identifies tweets using Xpath and iterates through pages via the "Load older Tweets" button.
- **Tools Required**: Install a User-Agent switcher (e.g., [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-agent-switcher-for-c/djflhoibgkdhkhhcedjiklpkjnoahfmg?hl=ru)) to emulate the mobile version for scraping.

### Solution 2: Short Script Using Tweepy
- **Author**: Dea Venditama ([Chatbots Life](https://chatbotslife.com/crawl-twitter-data-using-30-lines-of-python-code-e3fece99450e))
- **Overview**: This example demonstrates how to crawl tweets using just 30 lines of Python code with the `Tweepy` library. If youâ€™re approved for Twitterâ€™s API, this script provides a great starting point for creating a functional crawler.

### Solution 3: Overcoming API Tweet Limits
- **Author**: Dea Venditama ([Medium](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/crawling-twitter-data-without-authentication-8269d1c5b261))
- **Overview**: This solution explores how to bypass the APIâ€™s limits on retrieving tweets (typically capped at 3200). While no definitive solution is provided, the author discusses attempts using tools like `twitter_scraper` and `BeautifulSoup`.

If you encounter API or other limits while building a Python-based crawler, you can use third-party services like [Proxy Crawl](https://proxycrawl.com/how-to-scrape-twitter), which allows secure scraping of large datasets with minimal effort.

## Changing the User-Agent in Python

The User-Agent is a header representing the client (browser or bot) that sends a request to a server. For example, Google Chrome on Windows 10 has the following User-Agent:

```
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/86.0.4240.75 Safari/537.36
```

![User-Agent Example](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/yFkTaF2TzleAIiCS_V1wjOvvIQOof_GjU7atlRO4IfsD6qoVieQWThFhscCtp4-l0kQ_3CY9PyZ71dGittzW99IljEj1COsLI_pI4sVXmC_fz1m8XF7eHC-46CWrKsPRmFdnWWw)

### Why Change User-Agent?
Many websites block requests that contain default Python headers. To reduce the chances of being blocked, itâ€™s essential to change or randomize User-Agents with each request.

### Basic Example
Hereâ€™s how to pass a custom User-Agent into request headers:

```python
import requests

headers = {
    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/86.0.4240.75 Safari/537.36'
}
response = requests.get('https://mobile.twitter.com/hashtag/spider', headers=headers)
```

### Randomizing User-Agents
Use a list of User-Agents and randomly select one for each request:

```python
from random import choice
import requests

user_agents = [
    'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/54.0.2840.99 Safari/537.36',
    'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/54.0.2840.98 Safari/537.36',
    'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:50.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/50.0'
]

headers = {'User-Agent': choice(user_agents)}
response = requests.get('https://mobile.twitter.com/hashtag/spider', headers=headers)
```

### Using the `fake-useragent` Package
For up-to-date User-Agents, use the [`fake-useragent`](https://pypi.org/project/fake-useragent/) library:

```python
from fake_useragent import UserAgent
import requests

ua = UserAgent()
headers = {'User-Agent': ua.random}
response = requests.get('https://mobile.twitter.com/hashtag/spider', headers=headers)
```

By dynamically changing the User-Agent with each request, you reduce the risk of being blocked while crawling Twitter.

## Conclusion

Building a Twitter crawler is an excellent way to extract valuable insights from tweets, hashtags, and profiles. Whether you use tools like Tweepy or third-party APIs like Proxy Crawl, adapting your crawler to avoid detection is crucial. Changing User-Agents, using proxies, and following best practices can help ensure the success of your scraping efforts.
