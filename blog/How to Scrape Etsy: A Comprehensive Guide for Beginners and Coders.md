## Two Ways to Scrape Etsy Data

Below, we outline two methods for scraping Etsy data:
1. **Using a no-code Etsy scraper (ideal for beginners)**
2. **Using Python (perfect for coders)**

Letâ€™s dive into each method.

### **Method 1: Using a No-Code Etsy Scraper**

Gone are the days when web scraping was limited to coders. No-code tools like **Octoparse** have made web scraping accessible to anyone. Hereâ€™s how to use Octoparse to scrape Etsy step by step:

#### Step 1: Download and Install Octoparse

1. Visit the [Octoparse website](https://www.octoparse.com?fpr=lucky42) to download the tool.
2. Install Octoparse on your computer and create an account. You can use your Google or Microsoft account to log in.

#### Step 2: Input Etsyâ€™s URL

1. Open Octoparse and paste the URL of the Etsy page you want to scrape.
   - Example: A search results page for ["handmade candles"](https://www.etsy.com/search?q=handmade%20candles&ref=search_bar).

2. Click **Start** to load the Etsy page within Octoparse.

#### Step 3: Select Data to Extract

1. Once the page loads, Octoparse will automatically identify scrapable data, such as product titles, prices, and images.
2. Review the detected fields in the preview table. Remove unnecessary fields by clicking the trash bin icon.

#### Step 4: Adjust Data Labels

1. Rename any mislabeled columns by double-clicking on the column names.
2. Remove irrelevant data fields, such as button text or currency symbols.

#### Step 5: Run the Scraper

1. Click **Save** and then **Run** to start scraping.
2. Choose to run the scraper locally or in the cloud.

#### Step 6: Export the Data

1. Once the scraping task is complete, export the data in formats like Excel, CSV, or JSON for further analysis.

### **Method 2: Scraping Etsy Using Python**

For coders, Python offers a flexible way to scrape Etsy data. Here's how you can use Python to scrape Etsy step by step:

#### Prerequisites

- Install the `etsy-scraper` library: `pip install etsy_scraper`
- Import the library into your script: `import etsy_scraper`

#### Basic Python Script for Etsy Scraping

```python
import etsy_scraper

# Scraping product data
etsy_scraper.productScrape("https://www.etsy.com/listing/540091623/italian-garden-essential-oil-candle")

# Scraping vendor data
etsy_scraper.vendorScrape("https://www.etsy.com/shop/OctoandCo")
```

#### Limitations of the Library

The `etsy-scraper` library is limited in functionality and cannot scrape search result pages or handle pagination. To scrape these pages, youâ€™ll need to write custom code using Python libraries like **Requests** and **BeautifulSoup**.

### Scraping Etsy Without Being Blocked

Scraping large volumes of Etsy data requires sending multiple HTTP requests. This abnormal behavior can trigger Etsyâ€™s anti-bot systems, resulting in your scraper or IP address being blocked.

#### How to Avoid Being Blocked:

1. **Use Proxies**:
   Rotate IP addresses using services like residential or mobile proxies.
   
2. **Delay Requests**:
   Add delays between requests to mimic human behavior.

3. **Spoof Browser Fingerprints**:
   Use tools like AdsPower to mask your activities and bypass anti-scraping measures.

4. **Leverage ScraperAPI**:
   ScraperAPI simplifies scraping by handling CAPTCHA challenges, IP rotations, and anti-bot detection. Start your free trial here: [https://www.scraperapi.com/?fp_ref=coupons](https://www.scraperapi.com/?fp_ref=coupons).
