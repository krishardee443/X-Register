But what data should businesses collect? In the world of online sales, customer information can be categorized into four main groups:

### 1. Personal Data

This forms the foundation of your organization's understanding of customer relationships. Personal data can be divided into two types:

- **Personally Identifiable Information (PII):** Includes gender, full name, physical address, ID, etc., and allows businesses to identify individuals.
- **Non-PII (Non-Personally Identifiable Information):** Includes IP addresses, browser details, and other information that does not directly identify a person.

### 2. Behavioral Data

Behavioral data provides insight into how customers interact with your products or services. This includes:

- Information about product usage
- User clicks and mouse movements
- Transaction details, purchase history, and average order prices

> Analyzing customer behavior helps identify patterns and predict future purchase decisions.

### 3. Engagement Data

Engagement data reflects how customers interact with your business through various channels. Key metrics include:

- Page views

- Social media likes, shares, and comments
- E-book downloads and similar interactions

### 4. Attitudinal Data
