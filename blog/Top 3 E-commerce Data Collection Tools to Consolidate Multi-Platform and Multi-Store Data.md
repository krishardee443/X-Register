## 1. Jiushu Cloud BI Tool

Jiushu Cloud BI is an online **e-commerce data collection tool** and a comprehensive data visualization platform. It supports account authorization, API-based data extraction, and RPA-based data extraction, making it simple to meet e-commerce data collection needs. Without writing a single line of code, it can analyze datasets with millions of entries and create various e-commerce reporting systems with transparent and traceable analysis processes.

### **1) API and Account Authorization Data Extraction**

Most e-commerce platforms offer **official API interfaces**, allowing automated API-based data collection. For example:

- **Amazon Platform:** The official API enables sellers to directly download reports like orders, returns, inventory, traffic, and advertising data. With Jiushu Cloud, once an account is authorized, you can log in from any browser or device to sync and manage data, eliminating the need for manual downloads.
  
- **Taobao Platform:** Use Jiushu Cloud alongside tools like Business Advisor to collect e-commerce data.

- **Douyin Platform:** Integrate Jiushu Cloud with tools like E-commerce Compass for seamless data collection.

In addition to store-level data, you can also connect to industry datasets like Tao Data or Baidu Index using APIs. This helps sellers gain a broad market perspective, analyze trends, identify industry opportunities, and spot new product growth opportunities.

### **2) RPA-Based Data Extraction**

For scenarios where APIs are unavailable or manual exports are required, you can rely on **RPA (Robotic Process Automation)** to automate data collection. Think of RPA as a robot following instructionsâ€”for instance, entering Business Advisor, downloading competitor analysis reports, or gathering data based on provided product and competitor IDs. RPA works with 100% accuracy, automating repetitive tasks to extract any data displayed on e-commerce platform dashboards.

## 2. Database Tools

For sellers managing significant amounts of data with dedicated IT teams and local or cloud-based databases, **API interfaces combined with database tools** can effectively streamline data collection. Common local database solutions include:

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle
- SQL Server
- SQLite
- Access
- ClickHouse

Using these tools, businesses can integrate various e-commerce data streams into one centralized repository for analysis and management.

## 3. ERP Systems

In addition to the above-mentioned tools, some enterprises use **ERP systems** for indirect data collection to manage orders and procurement processes. ERP systems often have built-in data collection capabilities, allowing direct connections to e-commerce data stored in ERP/OMS systems. This makes ERP an effective solution for automating the integration of business and e-commerce data.

By leveraging these three types of e-commerce data collection tools, sellers of all sizes can integrate data from different platforms, unlocking the potential value of e-commerce data. These tools are not only user-friendly but also powerful, helping users extract actionable insights from vast datasets.
