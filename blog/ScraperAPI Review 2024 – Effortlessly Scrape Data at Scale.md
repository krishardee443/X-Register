## How to Implement ScraperAPI

ScraperAPI supports multiple integration methods such as API endpoints and proxy port SDKs. Below is an example of how to use ScraperAPI with **Node.js**.

### Implementing ScraperAPI in Node.js Using SDK Method

```javascript
const ScraperAPI = require('scraperapi-sdk');
const apiKey = 'YOUR_SCRAPERAPI_KEY'; // Replace with your ScraperAPI key
const scraper = new ScraperAPI(apiKey);

async function scrapeWebsiteContent(url) {
  try {
    let response = await scraper.get(url);
    console.log('Response data:', response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error scraping website:', error);
  }
}

let url = 'https://google.com'; // Replace with the URL you want to scrape
scrapeWebsiteContent(url);
```

### Code Explanation:

1. **Import ScraperAPI SDK**: The code imports the `scraperapi-sdk` library.
2. **Provide API Key**: Replace `YOUR_SCRAPERAPI_KEY` with your actual ScraperAPI key, which is provided upon registration.
3. **Initialize ScraperAPI**: The SDK is initialized using the API key.
4. **Define Async Function**: The `scrapeWebsiteContent` function takes a website URL as input and makes a GET request using the `scraper.get()` method.
5. **Error Handling**: The `try-catch` block ensures that errors are caught and logged.
6. **Log Data**: Successful responses are logged to the console.
7. **Run the Function**: Replace the example URL with your target site, and call the scraping function.

#### Note:
Before running the above code, install the SDK using the command:
```bash
npm install scraperapi-sdk
```
