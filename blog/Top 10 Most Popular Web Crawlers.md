## What Are Web Crawlers?

Web crawlers, also known as robots, spiders, or bots, are computer programs that methodically browse the Internet. They visit websites, read pages, and extract information to create search engine indexes. This allows search engines to provide users with up-to-date results for their queries.

In addition to indexing, web crawlers can collect specific types of data, like pricing or contact information, which businesses can use for SEO, marketing, or frontend optimization.

### Key Features of Web Crawlers:
- **Index Fresh Content**: Ensure your website is searchable.
- **Sitemap Integration**: Use sitemaps to guide crawlers.
- **Manage Crawling Traffic**: Use a `robots.txt` file to control bot behavior and avoid server overload.

### Example `robots.txt` Configurations:
1. **Disallow All Crawling**:
   ```plaintext
   User-agent: *
   Disallow: /
   ```

2. **Allow All Crawling**:
   ```plaintext
   User-agent: *
   Disallow:
   ```

## Bad Bots

Unfortunately, not all bots are beneficial. Some, like **PetalBot**, **SEMrushBot**, and **AhrefsBot**, are bad bots that can harm your site by consuming bandwidth or scraping content.

## Protecting Your Site from Malicious Bots

1. **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Filters bot traffic before it reaches your server.
2. **Leverage a CDN**: CDNs distribute content globally, reducing the risk of bot attacks.
3. **Enable Bad Bot Blocking**: Tools like KeyCDN automatically block known bad bots.
