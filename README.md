## Methods to Collect Customer Data

### 1. Transactional Data

Transactional data includes information collected through your websiteâ€™s point-of-sale system. This data provides insights into:

- Customer purchases
- Payment methods
- Returns and refunds
- Product popularity

By analyzing transactional data, you can make informed decisions about inventory management and customer trends.

### 2. Forms, Surveys, and Interviews

Adding forms during checkout or sending follow-up surveys allows customers to provide feedback. Quick ratings (e.g., out of 5 stars) are effective ways to measure customer satisfaction. You can also use chatbots to ensure 24/7 customer service and gather insights on shopper needs.

### 3. Social Media Insights

Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, X, and TikTok provide valuable data based on user engagement, including:

- Likes
- Shares
- Comments
- Brand mentions

This data offers a clearer understanding of how customers perceive your brand and interact with it.
